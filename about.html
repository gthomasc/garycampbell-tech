    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h1>
    <p class="mb-4">I work at the intersection of technology, operations, and people—helping organizations modernize how they actually function, not just what tools they use.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Over the past two decades, I’ve led enterprise-scale transformation inside a complex, people-driven organization, guiding the evolution from legacy, on-prem systems to cloud platforms, SaaS solutions, and AI-enabled workflows. My work sits in the “messy middle”: translating strategy into execution, aligning cross-functional teams, and redesigning systems so they are adopted, trusted, and sustained.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">AI has become a meaningful part of that work—but never in isolation. I focus on practical, human-in-the-loop applications that reduce friction, surface insight, and extend human capability rather than replace it.</p>
    <p>What defines my approach: systems thinking grounded in real operational constraints; change management that meets people where they are; clear translation between executives, technical teams, and frontline users; and a bias toward small wins that compound into durable transformation.</p>
